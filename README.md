## GPi Case Configuration

Your GPi Case must be in "Hat" input mode for correct operation.

If you're not able to navigate menus, set the input mode by holding **Up** on the D-Pad and **Select** for around five seconds, until the power LED flashes purple. Depending on your exact model of GPi Case, you may need to hold **Up** and **Start** instead.
