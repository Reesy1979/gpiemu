Instead of big config file, just config ui using folders and files

launcher\    Main folder to hold everything
	Skins\
		Sub folders will be the skins available
	Sections\
        	01_Emulators\      - icon for section will be skins/<skin name>/sections/emulators.png  (32x32 in size )
			01_drgb.txt
				File content
					title=DrGB
					icon=skin:icons/drgb.png  ( icons are 32x32 pixels )
					exec=/drgb.img
		Games\
		Apps\
        
Transverse the section folders
Build up top nav bar like gmenu2X - L and R will navigate sections - bit awkward on GPI - maybe allow navigate using buttons as well
                                    or maybe X and Y instead?

Then on the selected section
   transverse the items sub folders
   get total number of items
   allocate memory to hold details
   read details into memory
       ie load PNG into memory
          get icon name etc
   Render to screen
   Selected item will be high lighted - maybe have a red box around it rather than making it brighter
   up/down/left right will change selected item
   if you reach top of items, nav will move into section bar at the top - sections can then be navigate - press button to select new section etc
   
   if more items available than can be displayed then when you press down on last visible row icons, all icons will scroll up - instant scroll or animated..not sure.
   
   Thats it - easy.
   
   Can't get battery life, so can't add that
   Can't change CPU speed, so can't add that
   
   Just want it to look like gmenu2x but not need fucking SDL!!!!
